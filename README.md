## Description

The purpose of this app is to be able to add, edit, and remove descriptors of retail items from a database. The descriptors include 'product,' 'category,' and 'tag.' The retail item descriptors work together; for example, a 'product' has a 'category' it belongs to, and the product can have multiple 'tags.' A real-life example would be a 'product' of a children's green ninja turtle t-shirt. The 'category' might be children's clothing. Two 'tags' might be green and t-shirt.
